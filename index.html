                    I have worked as a web developer at the Webbyrå Petra where developed three new websites for the Swedish Open tennis competition.

                    My first project at HemoCue was to integrate atlas platform GUI (a platform that was under development in HemoCue) with the new resco GUI framework. This was to increase the performance of the device, for example, the new framework uses gradient to draw the background in GUI compared to the old one that uses images to represent each state of the GUI which takes more device resources.

                    I also created a web solution for the operations department at HemoCue. This website handles calibration data from a database and implemented search and statistics function. The main focus was on catching errors that occurred during calibration sessions.
